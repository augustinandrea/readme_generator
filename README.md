# README Generator Project
  [![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

  ## Description
  In this project I created a README Generator. The application starts and you are prompted with different questions related to different parts that should exists in a professional README. There is a license badge generated at the top and a license copyright section. There is a video showing an example of the process.
